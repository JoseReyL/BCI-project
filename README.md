psychopy is malfunctioning to me and doesnt allow me to put any images, so i started using pygame (psychopy is base on pygame anyway)

moving left into the 3 options menu is working properly, having an icon being green for some time before going into the next menu or going back doesnt work, I will have to correct it later


I have been rethinking about the navigate interface signal system and I think it should mimic more the main menu system, one right move offers, up and left, two right moves offer you right and down
To accept any of those two options move both hands, and right hand to choose, both hands to accept again
Left hand to move back
I'm not sure if it's the best option because it takes 4 moves to make any selection, but otherwise it wouldnt allow to go back
