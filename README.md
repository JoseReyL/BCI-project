psychopy is malfunctioning to me and doesnt allow me to put any images, so i started using pygame (psychopy is base on pygame anyway)

moving left into the 3 options menu is working properly, having an icon being green for some time before going into the next menu or going back doesnt work, I will have to correct it later
